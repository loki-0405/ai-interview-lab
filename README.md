# 🤖 AI-Powered Interview Assistant

This is a full-stack web application that simulates a real-time **AI Interview Chat** using a local LLM model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). The interface mimics a WhatsApp-style chat, where users can upload their **resume**, provide a **job title**, and a **job description** — the AI then plays the role of an interviewer.
